  <h1>Formbuilder Service Singleton Example</h1>
  <p>
    This project demonstrates the use of an injectable service as a
    way to provide a reactive form across multiple components.
    Additionally, providing this form as a singleton allows for the
    form's state to persist in the application, without writing code
    to perform any type of state management functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    The propagation of state across components and pages can be
    demonstrated by modifying the Name, Logo File, or Pin Image File
    fields and navigating to Provider 2 page.  You will observe that
    changes made on one page are reflected in the other page.  This
    is due to the fact that the same formbuilder service instance
    is provided to both pages.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project also demonstrates the use of font-awesome, and a
    method of styling the built-in html select list to make it more
    visually appealing.
